Is it possible to allow synchronous as well as asynchronous serialization for at least these types:
- AsyncLock
- AsyncConditionVariable
- AsyncMonitor (trivial if the above is possible)
That would allow us to build a synchronous/asynchronous producer/consumer queue.

Also consider IDisposable implementations that are only mutable when boxed.
